# FoodTruckProject

# Description
The food truck project is a project used to test someones understanding and use of programs in different classes and packages, including using imports, static and non-static fields, public and private fields, constructors, and methods.

In this program The user is asked to either provide a name for a food truck or to quit. If the user inputs a name they are then asked to give a type of food and a rating for the food truck. This allows the program to create a food truck in the array fleet[]. It assigns the food truck an ID based on the number of trucks entered up too that point. This process repeats until the user enters quit (not case sensitive) or their have been 5 trucks entered

The program then shows a menu to allow the user to choose if they want to: 
	1. List all of the food trucks (prints the toString for the truck)
	2. See the average rating for the trucks
	3. See the highest rated truck (prints the toString for the highest rated truck)
	4. Quit the program 

If the user inputs a number that is invalid they will be shown an error. Once a valid choice is made the program will execute the choice and bring up the menu again. This repeats until the user selects 4 (quit). in which the program gives an exit statement and ends.
